            InputOtp is an input component suitable for inserting fixed-size PINs or one time passwords (OTP).
        </p>
        <p>
            A one-time password (OTP), also known as a one-time PIN, one-time authorization code (OTAC) or dynamic password,
            is a password that is valid for only one login session or transaction, on a computer system or other digital device.
            OTPs avoid several shortcomings that are associated with traditional (static) password-based authentication;
            a number of implementations also incorporate two-factor authentication by ensuring that the one-time password
            requires access to something a person has (such as a small keyring fob device with the OTP calculator built into it,
            or a smartcard or specific cellphone) as well as something a person knows (such as a PIN).
